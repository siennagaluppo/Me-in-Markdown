## Introduction
  Hi I'm Sienna! I'm in 12th grade, 17 years young and this is my last year here :(. I actually enjoy coding! I thought I would hate it at first but last year I genuinley payed attention and when I understood it, it was so fun. I even passed the AP test with zero extra studying if I'm being honest. Im quite excited for this class and to learn more aboout coding. Although I dont plan on going down a computer science pathway for college, I think having a basic understanding is extremley valuable. For my future, I plan on going to UCSB (fingers crossed I get in) and studying psychology with a minor in buisness. This way I can become a talk therapist and work with my dad in his buisness. Psychology has always been quite interesting to me, I love talking, and its my dream to help people so being a therapist is kind of perfect for me. My current job is rolling burritos lol (Chipotle). Its a nice first job, the hours are flexible so im not always busy and it pays pretty well for being a teenage girl.
 
  I love cats. I have cats everywhere, my car, my phone case, my profile pictures, my purse, literally everywhere except my home. Unfortunatley I am allegic to cats. Honestly its pretty mild now that I'm older but my parents still refuse to get me an animal that once made me swell up so bad I looked like Rocky Balboa after he stepped out of the ring. But the second I get my own apartment I will infact be getting a cat and naming him Noodles. A lot of my time is spent at church. I volunteer and watch the 2 year olds every Sunday before service which is very fun. I love kids so much I cant wait to be a mom one day. But I also volunteer at our food pantries some Wednesday mornings and I go to our youth nights every Wednesday. Chuch is such a lovley outlet for me I love getting to spend time with my friends & Jesus. :)

I am 100% NOT a sports person. I always got told to try volleyball because I'm tall so I finally gave in and tried but turns it is definitely not my calling. I love music though, I've played the guitar for 3 years and I absolutley love it. It's such a nice form of expression and I also love getting to share it with my friends. Sometimes me and my friends have bible studies together and we get to play guitar and just sing, its so fun. I love all of my friends. Most of my summer consisted of hanging out with them. No matter what they are always here for me and I am so greatful for them. This summer we all went to the beach and it was definatley my favorite memory. Knowing its our last year together is bittersweet. I'm very excited for all the senior activities together and to enjoy every last moment. All in all I'm doing very well and I'm very excited for this class! :D
